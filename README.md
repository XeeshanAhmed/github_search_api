# A Search App that uses GitHub API to find all the users matching the input

Minor change in Readme by main branch
How to run:
1-Clone repo
2-Download dependencies
3-Run the server

1. Made using CRA template, I cleaned up the folder structure and removed 'unnecessary' files such as test setups
2. This app makes use of Axios, instead of the default 'fetch' api to make the fetching of data more efficient and easier
