# A Search App that uses GitHub API to find all the users matching the input
Minor change in Readme by main branch
1. Made using CRA template, I cleaned up the folder structure and removed 'unnecessary' files such as test setups
2. This app makes use of Axios, instead of the default 'fetch' api to make the fetching of data more efficient and easier
